Instructions: 
Start at the entrance. Choose a destination and collect the colored coins.

Chocolate house (pink)
Boba pond (orange)
Oreo Castle (blue)
M&M beach (yellow)

All the coins are on the way. Players need to go to the way that has their coins on it. They need to read the whole map (the board) 
first to make sure they are always on the right way. They will make several decisions. If they fall on anything, the game will be over. 
There are numbers on the different ways when people need to choose which way to go. When the players get into the place "somewhere", 
they need to click on the next section. There will be a count-down. After the 10 seconds count-down, someone needs to click on the last 
section. The player needs to choose a way and follow the way to get into the destiny they chose. If they didn‚Äôt get into the one they 
chose, they will fail this game.)

They will make several decisions. If they fall on anything, the game will be over. There are numbers on the different ways when people need to choose which way to go. When the players get into the place ‚Äúsomewhere‚Äù, they need to click on the next section. There will be a count-down. After the 10 seconds count-down, someone needs to click on the last section. The player needs to choose a way and follow the way to get into the destiny they chose. If they didn‚Äôt get into the one they chose, they will fail this game."
